Bio

I'm a junior web developer with hands-on experience in building responsive and fast websites. I'm also a continuous learner, always looking for effective ways to overcome a challenge. In addition, I'm passionate about improving user’s interaction with a website.

I've been mostly focused on my Front End skills, but I also have experience working with the Back End. On the Front End, I’ve been mostly using HTML, CSS, JS, on the Back End I’ve been mostly using PostgreSQL and NodeJS. I also have experience volunteering as a Computer Tutor back at my college. Right now, I'm working on my portfolio and preparing myself for the upcoming interviews.
